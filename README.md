## Beginner Level: Project_3 - Bigmart Sales Prediction (using XGBoost ML Algorithm)

### Problem Statement:

- Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales of various products in BigMart stores based on historical sales data and other relevant attributes such as the type and size of the outlet, location and visibility. The goal is to use this model to identify key factors that influence sales and to make recommendations for improving sales and profitability. The dataset contains information on various products sold across different outlets and their sales performance over a period of time.
